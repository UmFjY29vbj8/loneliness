if anyone finds this i am okay now, don't know why i was so sad but i got over it i guess
i doubt anyone will find this anytime soon though as no one has in the span of about a week
i seriously thought someone would find this by now
looking back at it it's actually kinda embarrassing that i made this whole thing but it's something that happened i guess
i could delete it but why would i really
maybe i'll use this as my own diary or a collection of my thoughts or whatever
maybe i would still be sad if it wasn't for my friends

i have other things to worry about than a silly computer game though
i have already gone on many rants about technical documentation, which is just fancy geometry
really fucking hard too
i'm so glad we wont have it next year
there is still work that i dont really know how to do and it's just piling up
i sometimes wish i wasn't so lazy

christmas is getting closer and closer and so is the summer break
i've been really getting forward to meeting both diamond and error this year but the whole thing wasn't really discussed that much
cuz about two days ago i kinda just suggested that i would be meeting him on august
and diamond said why august, that's almost the end of the summer break (or something like that i dont know exactly)
i kinda just assumed that diamond's (and error's) summer break lasts about the same as mine
my plan was i would work on july so i would have enough money for a plane
tbh i don't even know exactly where diamond lives, and idk if i should ask
my parents already said yes to the whole thing so

fuck, this whole year went by so fast
9th grade went by so fast and i dont remember much about it (except the academy play thing preparation when we all kinda got drunk and it was a big problem)
