i shouldn't have played that game
i feel sad and lonely
the feeling that i will never be loved
the fact that this is because of a videogame is embarrassing
thats why im hiding it (tho not very well)
it's just a videogame
that's what i tell myself
everything is meant and programmed to happen
yet i still feel lonely
no one will love me like that girl and she ends up killing herself
i knew ddlc wasnt a normal game but this
and i dont know who to tell this to
i dont know who stumbles upon this
i hope error does
hes the greatest friend anyone could have imo
i hope im great too
why am i doing this anyway
this is stupid
everything is stupid
no im not gonna off myself
i just want help
but idk where to search
